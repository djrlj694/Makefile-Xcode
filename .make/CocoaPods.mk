# Internal Constants
#
# An internal constant is a variable that is intended to:
#
# 1. Have a fixed value;
# 2. Be set within a makefile (e.g., "Makefile") or an "include"-ed file).
#
# It is typically defined using the ":=" assignment operator to "simply" expand
# its right-hand side -- i.e., immediately evaluate any variables thererin,
# saving the resulting text as final the value.
#
# By convention, internal constants use uppercase words, separated by dashes.

# Phony Targets
#
# A phony target is one that does not represent a file or directory. It can be
# thought of as an embedded shell script to be run when an explicit request
# is made unless uness a file of the same name exists.
#
# Two reasons to use a phony target are:
#
# 1. To avoid a conflict with a file of the same name;
# 2. To improve performance.

# Intermediate Targets
#
# An intermediate target corresponds to a file that is needed on the way from a
# source file to a target file.  It typically is a temporary file that is needed
# only once to generate the target after the source changed.  The "make" command
# automatically removes files that are identified as intermediate targets.  In
# other words, such files that did not exist before a "make" run executed do not
# exist after a "make" run.
